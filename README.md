# didactic-spoon 

The repo to put @deeplizard YouTube tutorials/courses. Thanks to auto-suggestion for the repo name, GitHub!

## Main Channel Reference

Tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/@deeplizard

@TODO go to YouTube and find info about @deeplizard, the channel, the goals, the correct citation, etc.

@TODO Ask @deeplizard if they are okay with me make notebooks out of their courses. I imagine they will be, since they have put the complete notebooks elsewhere. I still would like to check. I'll tell them I like to enter all the code and the notes myself, and that doing so has been a good education for Jupyter Notebooks on `git`.

## Courses Being Run Through - Info, link to my Jupyter Notebook notes, and the [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) link buttons.

### Deep Learning: Content-Based ML Intro, then Coding-Based Tensorflow Tutorials

@TODO Put up the Windows Notebook. Later, put in a UNIX Notebook. Probably use MyBinder, too.

#### TensorFlow - Python Deep Learning Neural Network API

@TODO Put up the Windows Notebook. Later, put in a UNIX Notebook. Probably use MyBinder, too.
