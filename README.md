# didactic-spoon 

The repo to put @deeplizard YouTube tutorials/courses. Thanks to auto-suggestion for the repo name, GitHub!

## Main Channel Reference

Tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/@deeplizard

@TODO go to YouTube and find info about @deeplizard, the channel, the goals, the correct citation, etc.

@TODO Ask @deeplizard if they are okay with me make notebooks out of their courses. I imagine they will be, since they have put the complete notebooks elsewhere. I still would like to check. I'll tell them I like to enter all the code and the notes myself, and that doing so has been a good education for Jupyter Notebooks on `git`.

## Courses Being Run Through - Info, link to my Jupyter Notebook notes, and the [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org) link buttons.

### Deep Learning: Content-Based ML Intro, then Coding-Based Tensorflow Tutorials

(For the above)

> Machine Learning / Deep Learning / Keras - Jupyter Notebooks <br/>
> This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and other resources used in the following deeplizard YouTube playlists:

> Keras Machine Learning / Deep Learning Tutorial
> Machine Learning & Deep Learning Fundamentals

### Deep Learning Fundamentals - Intro to Neural Networks

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZmobeGL0Yg&list=PLZbbT5o_s2xq7LwI2y8_QtvuXZedL6tQU

@TODO Put up the Windows Notebook. Later, put in a UNIX Notebook. Probably use MyBinder, too.

### TensorFlow - Python Deep Learning Neural Network API

@TODO Put up the Windows Notebook. Later, put in a UNIX Notebook. Probably use MyBinder, too.
